.SH OPTIONS
Option Syntax\n

Since Iso9660 Analyzer tool uses GNU getopt to process command-line arguments, every
option has a long form along with the short one.  Long options are more
convenient to remember, but take time to type.  You may freely mix
different option styles, or specify options after the command-line
arguments.  Thus you may write:\n

        \tiat --iso --input=FOO.img -o FOO.iso\n

The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument may
be omitted.  Instead of -o log you can write -oFOO.iso\n

You may put several options that do not require arguments together,
like:\n

        \tiat -xi FOO.img\n

This is a complete equivalent of:\n

       \tiat -x -i FOO.img\n\n

.SH BUGS
You are welcome to submit bug reports via the Iso9660 Analyzer Tool bug tracker (see
<https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=6784>).

Before actually submitting a bug report, please try to follow a few
simple guidelines.

1.  Please try to ascertain that the behavior you see really is a bug.
If iat crashes, it's a bug.  If iat does not behave as
documented, it's a bug.  If things work strange, but you are not
sure about the way they are supposed to work, it might well be a
bug, but you might want to double-check the documentation and the
mailing lists.

2.  Try to repeat the bug in as simple circumstances as possible.  E.g.
if iat crashes while convert iat --toc -i FOO.img -o FOO try to see 
if the crash is repeatable, and if will occur with a simpler set of 
options.
                

3.  Please start iat with --debug  option and send us the resulting output

	iat --debug -i FOO.img > FOO.log

Note: please make sure to remove any potentially sensitive
information from the debug log before sending it to the bug
address.  

4.  If iat has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g. "gdb `which
